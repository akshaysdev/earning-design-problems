# How to run the code

I have provided scripts to execute the code. 

Use `run.sh` to execute the code for all problems. The file run the commands silently and prints only output from the input file `sample_input/input.txt`. You are supposed to add the input commands in the file from the appropriate problem statement passing the type of problem on first line and input in the second line.

Alternatively run,
`npm start --silent sample_input/input.txt`
